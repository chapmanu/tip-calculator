## Overview

Turns out the Chapman web team is **_really_** bad at calculating tips. We made a sweet new application to solve this problem! Unfortunately, there seems to be some bugs. Please fix.

Also, ~~-Overlord-~~ Ross is demanding new features. Build those too.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Clone the tip-calculator repository from https://github.com/chapmanu/tip-calculator to the directory named **challenge** in your user directory (i.e. your working directory will be ~/challenge/tip-calculator).
* Make a new branch to collect your commits.
* When complete, the index page should correctly calculate the tip for the given inputs.
* Build as many of the features as you can.

### Feature Requests

* Round output to 2 decimal points
* Change *cost*'s form field to default to 0
* Change *cost* to accept only numbers (both ints and floats). You shouldn't be able type non-numbers into the field
* Change the validation error from "Num people can't be blank" to "**Number of People** can't be blank"
* Change *Number of People* input into a slider, and set the default to 1
* **BONUS**: Change cost to have "$" in front of number

#### Tips

* Laptop login is: candidate / candidate123
* You may need to run bundle install after you clone the repository.
* Sublime Text 2 (Text Editor) is available in the dock.
* Fix any errors before building anything.
* There are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing!
* You're free to use any of the tools on the computer, including the internet.
* You're also allowed to ask questions to any of the team members present.
